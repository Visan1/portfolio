## **Data Analytics Projects**
### Navigating the COVID-19 Crisis in Alberta: Data Insights to Optimize Healthcare Resource Allocation (Excel, Power BI)
#### Question to Answer: What are the differences in the reported cases of COVID-19 for Edmonton, Calgary and other major zones in Alberta and how can health care resources be distributed to more effectively tackle the situation of COVID-19 in each zone based on this analysis?

### Key Insights:
-	**High Case Concentration Zones:** The Calgary and Edmonton zones combined accounted for approximately 73% of total confirmed COVID-19 cases.
-	**Demographics Most Affected:** The most affected age groups are 30-39, 20-29, and 40-49 years old age groups. Additionally, in 2022, reported cases among females surpassed those of males by approximately 30,000.
-	**Seasonal Trends:** Spikes in cases are observed from October to January and again from March to April, correlating with holiday gatherings and seasonal changes.
-	**Probable and Confirmed Cases:** Only 0.80% of cases are classified as “probable,” emphasizing the need to focus on confirmed cases for accurate reporting and resource allocation.
-	**Rapid Rate of Change:** The significant fluctuations in case numbers, particularly in the fall and winter months, highlights the need for a flexible approach to resource allocation.
-	**Older Population Disparity:** There is a notable amount in the reported cases for females aged 80 and above, indicating a potential trend in cases for this demographic.
